# Counting the number of group orbits by marrying the Burnside process with importance sampling

This repository contains the implementation of the counting algorithms in the paper:

Persi Diaconis, Chenyang Zhong. Counting the number of group orbits by marrying the Burnside process with importance sampling. 

Counting_Bose_Einstein.R implements the counting algorithm for the example in Section 3 of the paper.

Counting_Unitriangular.py implements the counting algorithm for the number of conjugacy classes of unitriangular groups in Section 4 of the paper.
